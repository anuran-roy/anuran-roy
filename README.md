### So, who am I? ðŸ˜„

I am a simple guy - someone who likes to buold stuff - either from data or from scratch (whenever not much data is available of coure :P)

I started coding on my own from free tutorials online, which built into me the habit of reading documentation. (Yeah, even the EULAs)

### Some of my works: 

1. Drax (My favourite piece of work)
2. OpnRank (Another favourite)
