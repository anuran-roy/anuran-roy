### So, who am I? 😄

I am a simple guy - someone who likes to build stuff 🧑‍🔧- either from data or from scratch (whenever not much data is available of course 😜)

I started coding on my own from free tutorials online, which built into me the habit of reading documentation. (Yeah, even the EULAs 😆)

### What I work with:



### Some of my works: 

1. [Drax](https://github.com/anuran-roy/drax) (My favourite piece of work) 
2. [OpnRank](https://github.com/anuran-roy/OpnRank) (Another favourite)

### Status:

#### 1. Actively Contributing to 😃: [**OWASP Maryam**](https://github.com/saeeddhqan/Maryam)
#### 2. Working in free time on 😅: [**Drax**](https://github.com/anuran-roy/drax)
#### 3. Almost on hiatus 🙁: [**OpnRank**](https://github.com/anuran-roy/OpnRank)

### My pastimes:

When you'll not find me coding, you'll find doing one of these stuff:

1. Sleeping,
2. Playing football,
3. Reading storybooks,
4. Surfing sites for new buzzwords, or
5. Reading books.
